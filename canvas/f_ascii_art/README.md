the Access-Control-Allow-Origin maybe a key barrier to the image contents of javascript and I need more solution to this issue.

the ImageData object is the key of this software.

this demo accomplishes the ascii art by color of the pixel and its position. I think font size & contour info has some rooms to make performance better.
